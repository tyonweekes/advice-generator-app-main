## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Advice Slip JSON API

### What I learned

I practiced using an API on a project on my own here. It was pretty straight-forward. I also improved my layout skills here too.

### Continued development

I would love to continue using APIs and dealing with JSON data. React is also something that I want to practice using on my own.

### Useful resources

- [Display Random Advice On Your Website or Web App Using Advice Slip JSON API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AfzKmgqWUE) - This refeshed my memory on how to use the Fetch API and also how to use this advice API.

- [CSS for Button Glow Effect on Hover](https://superdevresources.com/css-button-glow-effect//) - I learned how to make the dice button glow and animate from some of the CSS here.
